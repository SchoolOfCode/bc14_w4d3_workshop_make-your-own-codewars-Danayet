/* The traffic light is red and has a stop sign, have the traffic light change to yellow and return slow down, and then back to green to return go. To simulate the behavior of a traffic light that changes from red to yellow and then to green, you can use a combination of setTimeout() and Promise

Tips
You can use setTimeout() to imitate the traffic light sequence.
The function should return a string.
The function should have a delay of 2 seconds between each light change.
You can assume that the function is called in the correct sequence (red, yellow, green).
